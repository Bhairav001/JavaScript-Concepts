/*
 
&& and || are logical operators used for combining and evaluating expressions in logical operatios.
They also exhibit a behavior called short-circuiting.

which can be particularly useful in certain situations.


1. Logical AND (&&)

The && operator returnsn true if bothof its operands are true.
Otherwise, it returns false;

it short-circuits if the first operand is false,
meaning it doen't evaluate the second operand becasues the overall result will always be false
if the first operand is false;
